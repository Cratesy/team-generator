## Description

I've been tasked with making a Team generator.
which uses inquirer to prompt for the questions.
which uses jest for testing.

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:Cratesy/team-generator.git
cd team-generator
npm install
```

## Usage

When run, a user is prompted with questions, the user has to fill out answers which are stored.
Doing this generates a html file which uses information from the questions answered.
It populates the team name, and cards for each employee.
